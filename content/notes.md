1. [Introduction to de Rham cohomology.](/drc.pdf) Notes I wrote while studying de Rham cohomology sometime in 2021.
2. [The derived functor approach to sheaf cohomology.](http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2021/REUPapers/Niemiro.pdf) Last updated 9/29/2021. My paper for the University of Chicago REU, 2021.
3. [Course notes for 514, Complex Algebraic Geometry.](/math514.pdf) Notes for Math 514. Incomplete, and the quality was probably brought down by my 10-week case of Covid. These will probably only be helpful to classmates, and for future writing.
