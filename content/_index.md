Hi, my name is Matthew Niemiro. I study space and how we study space. This is my math (blog?)

## About Me

I'm a student at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I will graduate in 2024 with a degree in mathematics (major) and computer science (minor).

My email: (mylastname)2(at)illinois(dot)edu

## About This Site

I made this site to organize my mathematical stuff. It is partly motivational, since other people now see my writing. Maybe it'll get more serious when I'm in graduate school.
