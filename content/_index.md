Hi, my name is Matthew Niemiro. 

## About Me

I am an undergraduate at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I expect to graduate in 2024 with a degree in mathematics (major) and computer science (minor).

My email: (mylastname)2(at)illinois(dot)edu

## About This Site

I made this site to organize my mathematical notes, papers, thoughts, etc. that I have written or plan to write. It is also motivational, since in theory other people now see my work.

## About My Notes

As a personal project, I try to write short and focused notes on topics I want to understand better. I write these semi-regularly and make them available at my [Notes](/notes) page. Ideally, my notes will eventually compound into a far-reaching and cohesive mathematical resource.
