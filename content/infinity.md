It's a basic, cool, and important fact that spaces and categories have a common generalization in ∞-categories. This is a first step toward realizing an important relationship between space and algebra, and this buys you e.g. the application of higher category theory to algebraic topology, geometry, ... And these applications have had serious successes, e.g. the proof of the geometric cobordism hypothesis. Nowadays, ∞-categories are the "right" way to talk about and understand concepts in many parts of modern mathematics. That includes the mathematics I am interested in. 

Being such a big and formal and loaded area, maybe a good way to learn higher category theory is to chip away at it slowly and over a long time. As a personal project, I'm going to try this. Probably a serious goal is to read Jacob Lurie's *Higher Topos Theory*, but that's a hard (huge) read, and not all-encompassing. So I'll be drawing on many references. 

I'm texing [notes](/hcnotes.pdf) for this. The motto is "slow and steady." I'm writing these notes as I learn, and I'm not pruning them, they're for my own reference. Maybe they will be useful for something more intentional and comprehensive in the future.

UPDATE: this spring, some grad students are arranging a reading course on the subject. I am joining them for some time. They are following closely Charles Rezk's notes (under his advision).
