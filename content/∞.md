It's a very cool and important fact that spaces and categories have a common generalization in ∞-categories. This is the first step of a long and rich mathematical story about the application of higher category theory to algebraic topology, geometry, ... And these applications have had serious successes, e.g. proof of the geometric cobordism hypothesis. Nowadays, ∞-categories are the "right" way to talk about and understand concepts in many parts of modern mathematics. That includes the mathematics I am interested in. 

So, I'm studying higher category theory, with Lurie's *Higher Topos Theory* as the central reference. That's a huge book! To make matters worse, it is not really suitable as a standalone read. So I'll be calling on *many* additional references.

As a personal project, I'm texing [notes](/Daily_HTT.pdf) about my day-to-day studies for this. The motto is "slow and steady." I'm not pruning these notes---they're mainly for my own personal reference. They may serve well for something more intentional and comprehensive in the future.
