      "description": "The greatest stories do not begin with oo-category theory, and neither will ours—the germs of semiadditivity subsist willingly upon <i>ordinary</i> categories, ready for swab and cultivation. We will start our seminar by documenting some of the most basic semiadditive phenomena (in particular, negative one and zero semiadditivity) as it is expressible in ordinary language. Then we will anticipate higher algebraic extensions of the theory."
