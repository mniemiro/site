      "speaker": "Matthew Niemiro (Harvard)",
      "description": "The greatest stories do not begin with oo-category theory, and neither will ours. The germs of semiadditivity subsist willingly upon <i>ordinary</i> categories, ready for swab and cultivation. We will start our seminar by documenting some of the most basic semiadditive phenomena (in particular: bilimits, enrichments, norms, and ambidexterity for negative one and zero semiadditivity) as it is expressible in ordinary language. Then we will anticipate extensions of the theory. Finally, we will create a <i>hostage situation</i> to canvass speakers."

      "title": "I am NORMal and can be trusted with BOTH MY LEFT AND RIGHT HANDS",
      "speaker": "Matthew Niemiro (Harvard)",
      "description": "In this session, we will make the first definition of semiadditivity using <i>ambidexterity and norms</i>. The basic idea is that semiadditivity amounts to the existence of certain bilimits, hence it is a property concerning certain families F : X \\to C where F and X are variable. This, in turn, may be understood inductively by analyzing the existence and invertibility of norm maps. But there's still a lot going on. The role of ambidexterity is to isolate that part of semiadditivity concerning X in a functorial and controllable manner, and this will help us run the machine. In particular, we will use ambidexterity to construct relative integration, a “higher” form of addition that will clarify the existence problem for norms."

      "speaker": "Sam Munoz-Echaniz (MIT)",
      "description": "We previously defined semiadditivity using ambidexterity. The essential byproduct of ambidexterity was integration, which is a \"higher\" addition we used to construct norms. In this talk, we will see just how essential integration was: we will discuss the relationship between spans and addition, characterize semiadditivity in spanish, and discuss examples."
