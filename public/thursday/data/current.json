      "speaker": "Matthew Niemiro (Harvard)",
      "description": "The greatest stories do not begin with oo-category theory, and neither will ours. The germs of semiadditivity subsist willingly upon <i>ordinary</i> categories, ready for swab and cultivation. We will start our seminar by documenting some of the most basic semiadditive phenomena (in particular, negative one and zero semiadditivity) as it is expressible in ordinary language. Then we will anticipate higher algebraic extensions of the theory. Finally, we will create a <i>hostage situation</i> to canvass speakers."

      "title": "I am NORMal and can be trusted with BOTH MY LEFT AND RIGHT HANDS",
      "speaker": "Matthew Niemiro (Harvard)",
      "description": "In this session, we will make the first definition of semiadditivity using <i>ambidexterity and norms</i>. The basic idea is that semiadditivity amounts to the existence of certain bilimits, hence it is a property concerning certain families F : X \\to C where F and X are variable. This, in turn, may be understood inductively by analyzing the existence and invertibility of norm maps. But there's still a lot going on. The role of ambidexterity is to isolate that part of semiadditivity concerning X in a functorial and controllable manner, and this will help us run the machine. In particular, we will use ambidexterity to construct relative integration, a “higher” form of addition that will clarify the existence problem for norms."

      "speaker": "Sam Munoz-Echaniz (MIT)",
      "description": "We previously defined semiadditivity using ambidexterity. The essential biproduct of ambidexterity was integration, which is a \"higher\" addition, which we used to construct norms. In this talk, we will see just how essential integration was: we will discuss the relationship between spans and addition, characterize semiadditivity in spanish, and look into the horizon."
