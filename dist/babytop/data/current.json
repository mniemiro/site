  "semester": "Fall 2025: Trace Methods I",
  "topic": "This semester, Babytop will focus on trace methods in the classical setting, as well as their applications to algebraic geometry, topology, and representation theory. Some of our main references include Loday's book on cyclic homology, Weibel's book on K-theory, and Ferdinand Wagner's notes for Hebestreit's course on K-theory.",

      "title": "An introduction to Hochschild homology",
      "speaker": "Ari Krishna",
      "affiliation": "Harvard",
      "abstract": "We introduce Hochschild homology, which may be motivated as follows: given an associative algebra A and an A-bimodule M, we may ask for a universal A-bimodule from M for which the left and right actions agree. We will discuss how to compute it, talk about the bar resolution, and make explicit the relationship to the derived world via Tor. Lastly, we will discuss the HKR isomorphism relating Hochschild homology of smooth algebras to algebras of differential forms."

      "title": "Cyclic homology",
      "speaker": "Oakley Edens",
      "affiliation": "Harvard",
      "abstract": "In this talk, we will continue the discussion of the last two talks by defining a new homology theory called cyclic homology which we construct from Hochschild homology by taking group homology with respect to the various cyclic group actions on the cyclic bar complex. We give some intuition for this construction as \"taking homotopy orbits for the S^1-action on Hochschild homology\", something that will be elaborated on in future talks. We then discuss the Connes periodicity sequences for cyclic homology, the comparison with de Rham cohomology and the λ-decomposition on cyclic homology."

      "title": "Application: Lie algebra homology",
      "speaker": "Jonathan Buchanan",
      "affiliation": "MIT",
      "abstract": "In this talk, we will discuss the Loday--Quillen--Tsygan theorem, which gives an isomorphism between the Lie algebra homology of the Lie algebra of matrices in some k-algebra A to the cyclic homology of A. We explain how to lift the trace map from gl(A) to A to a map of cyclic homologies and use this to construct the isomorphism."

      "title": "Circle Actions I",
      "speaker": "Matthew Niemiro",
      "affiliation": "Harvard",
      "abstract": "Nor’easters usually occur when tropical Gulf Stream currents come up and off the Atlantic and meet colder arctic air masses coming down from Canada. In more ways than one, a nor’easter is here—in this talk, I will explain the less evident vortex of frigid algebra and humid topology that underscores the meteorological event which threatened my flight here and my bike ride to the gym. To be precise, I will present some models for our current algebraic formulations of Hochschild-type invariants and dwell upon the presence of S^1-actions in these models. This will offer alternative, new, and perhaps even interesting formulations of certain properties of our invariants that will be important moving forward. Time permitting, we may say something about consequences for the homology of group algebras."

      "title": "Circle Actions II",
      "speaker": "Samuel Munoz",
      "affiliation": "MIT",
      "abstract": "Last time, we discussed three different ways to model the S^1-action on Hochschild homology, which lead to a better description of cyclic homologies. In this talk, I will use some of these models to explore several examples, including the cyclic homology of a cyclic space. As a consequence, we will see an interesting relationship between cyclic homology and S^1-equivariant homology of free loop spaces."
